## Introduction for instructors


This page describes a course module for teaching parallelism with OpenMPI in Python. The materials are adapted from those used in teaching the BIO 371 DIVAS Seminar II, which was the capstone course for our [Digital Imaging and Vision Applications in Science (DIVAS)](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1608754&HistoricalAwards=false) program. The course description for this course is:


>This seminar is a capstone to the Doane Digital Imaging and Vision 
>Applications in Science Project and is intended for DIVA scholars. Students 
>mentor incoming DIVA scholars by occasionally participating in DIVAS 
>Seminar I. Students will develop and present a summary of their research to 
>students in DIVAS Seminar I, most likely at MindExpo. Finally, students 
>will explore various ways to use supercomputing and parallelism to solve a 
>variety of problems. DIVA scholars are required to enroll in this course 
>after completing summer research.
> 
>Some specific activities for our semester are listed below:
> 
>- Git, bash, Python, OpenCV review 
>- Use of Onyx or other supercomputer
>    - Parallel architectures, problem-solving methodologies, etc.
>    - When / what to parallelize
>    - Language-specific implementation
>    - SLURM batch files, etc. 
>- Solving a variety of problems from different disciplines
>    - Application of above in a project 
>- Mentoring DIVAS I cohort
>- MindExpo presentation regarding DIVAS I activities / summer research


The DIVAS Seminar II course was taught to non-computing majors who had minimal programming experience. So, our approach was to introduce the subject of parallelism in as simple a way as possible.
